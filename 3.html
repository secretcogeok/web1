  <h2>Pure and precise shifting</h2>

  <p>
    Every part had to earn its way onto this car,
    and the standard <strong>dual-clutch transmission</strong> is no different.
    It features lightning-quick shifts,
    combining the smoothness of an automatic with the action of a manual.
    And since thereâ€™s no deceleration between shifts, your lap times will benefit too.
